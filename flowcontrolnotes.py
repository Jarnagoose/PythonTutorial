#boolean datatype only has True and False, aka a binary oh boy
#comparison operators
#== equal to
# != Not equal to
# < less than
# > greater than
# <= less than or equal to
# >= greater than or equal to
#42 == 42
#42 == 41
# expressions with comparison operators evaluate to a boolean value
#string values will not equal integer values
#42 == '42'
#float and integer however can be equal to eachother
#20.00 == 20
#Variable assignment operator is one equal sign
#Equals to is two equal signs
#Boolean operators are 'and' 'or' 'not'
#True and True 
#Truth tables for and
# True and True evaluates to True
# True and False == False
# False and True == False
# False and False == False
#or operator becomes true as long as one of the requirements are met, only False if both are False
#True or False
#Truth tables for or
# True or True == True
# True or False == True
# False or True == True
# False or False == False
#not False
#The not operator only operates on one boolean value
#Truth table for not
#not True == False
#not False == True
